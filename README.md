# Automated Banking Database Population in MySQL

This project is a comprehensive Banking Database Management system developed using MySQL, Python, and the Faker library. It allows you to create and manage a banking database effortlessly.

## Overview

The creation of a MySQL database for banking administration is automated by this project. You may build all the required tables and use Faker to fill them with dummy data by running the given Python script. This simplifies the process of creating dummy entries and configuring the database tables.

## Requirements

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following requirements met:

- Python 3.10 installed on your system.
- A MySQL server installed and running.
- The `mysql-connector-python` package installed. You can install it using ```pip install mysql-connector-python```.
- Access to your MySQL server with the necessary privileges to create databases and tables.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Banking Database Management system:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Automated-Banking-Database-Population-in-MySQL
   ```

3. Execute the Python script to create the database and populate it with dummy data:

   ```
   python3 main.py
   ```

   This script will create the necessary tables and populate them with dummy data for testing.

5. You can now use the database for banking management.
